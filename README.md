# Interpreter Rust

A simple interpreter coded in Rust.


My goal with this project is to learn Rust, and more about how interpreters work. My starting point is no knowledge of Rust at all, and while I know the principle of interpreters, I don't know the algorithms and structures they rely upon.


This project will therefore have limited functionality and documentation for now while I'm still learning and playing with Rust's features, but I may choose to expand and complete it later on.
